# <a name="manage-and-deploy-resources-to-azure-stack-with-azure-cli"></a>Manage and deploy resources to Azure Stack with Azure CLI

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Follow the steps in this article to set up the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) to manage Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) resources from Linux, Mac, and Windows client platforms.

## <a name="prepare-for-azure-cli"></a>Prepare for Azure CLI

If you're using the ASDK, you need the CA root certificate for Azure Stack to use Azure CLI on your development machine. You use the certificate to manage resources through the CLI.

 - **The Azure Stack CA root certificate** is required if you're using the CLI from a workstation outside the ASDK.  

 - **The virtual machine aliases endpoint** provides an alias, like "UbuntuLTS" or "Win2012Datacenter." This alias references an image publisher, offer, SKU, and version as a single parameter when deploying VMs.  

The following sections describe how to get these values.

### <a name="export-the-azure-stack-ca-root-certificate"></a>Export the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you're using an integrated system, you don't need to export the CA root certificate. If you're using the ASDK, export the CA root certificate on an ASDK.

To export the ASDK root certificate in PEM format:

1. Get the name of your Azure Stack Root Cert:
    - Sign in to the Azure Stack User or Administrator portal.
    - Click on **Secure** near the address bar.
    - On the pop-up window, Click **Valid**.
    - On the Certificate Window, click **Certification Path** tab.
    - Note down the name of your Azure Stack Root Cert.

    ![Azure Stack Root Certificate](media/azure-stack-version-profiles-azurecli2/root-cert-name.png)

2. [Create a Windows VM on Azure Stack](azure-stack-quick-windows-portal.md).

3. Sign in to the VM, open an elevated PowerShell prompt, and then run the following script:

    ```powershell  
      $label = "<the name of your azure stack root cert from Step 1>"
      Write-Host "Getting certificate from the current user trusted store with subject CN=$label"
      $root = Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\Root | Where-Object Subject -eq "CN=$label" | select -First 1
      if (-not $root)
      {
          Write-Error "Certificate with subject CN=$label not found"
          return
      }

    Write-Host "Exporting certificate"
    Export-Certificate -Type CERT -FilePath root.cer -Cert $root

    Write-Host "Converting certificate to PEM format"
    certutil -encode root.cer root.pem
    ```

4. Copy the certificate to your local machine.


### <a name="set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint"></a>Set up the virtual machine aliases endpoint

You can set up a publicly accessible endpoint that hosts a VM alias file. The VM alias file is a JSON file that provides a common name for an image. You use the name when you deploy a VM as an Azure CLI parameter.

1. If you publish a custom image, make note of the publisher, offer, SKU, and version information that you specified during publishing. If it's an image from the marketplace, you can view the information by using the ```Get-AzureVMImage``` cmdlet.  

2. Download the [sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json) from GitHub.

3. Create a storage account in Azure Stack. When that's done, create a blob container. Set the access policy to "public."  

4. Upload the JSON file to the new container. When that's done, you can view the URL of the blob. Select the blob name and then selecting the URL from the blob properties.

### <a name="install-or-upgrade-cli"></a>Install or upgrade CLI

Sign in to your development workstation and install CLI. Azure Stack requires version 2.0 or later of Azure CLI. The latest version of the API Profiles requires a current version of the CLI. You install the CLI by using the steps described in the [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) article. 

1. To verify whether the installation was successful, open a terminal or command prompt window and run the following command:

    ```shell
    az --version
    ```

    You should see the version of Azure CLI and other dependent libraries that are installed on your computer.

    ![Azure CLI on Azure Stack Python location](media/azure-stack-version-profiles-azurecli2/cli-python-location.png)

2. Make a note of the CLI's Python location. If you're running the ASDK, you need to use this location to add your certificate.


## <a name="windows-azure-ad"></a>Windows (Azure AD)

This section walks you through setting up CLI if you're using Azure AD as your identity management service, and are using CLI on a Windows machine.

### <a name="trust-the-azure-stack-ca-root-certificate"></a>Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you're using the ASDK, you need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. This step isn't needed with the integrated systems.

To trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate, append it to the existing Python certificate store for the Python version installed with the Azure CLI. You may be running your own instance of Python. Azure CLI includes its own version of Python.

1. Find the certificate store location on your machine.  You can find the location by running the command  `az --version`.

2. Navigate to the folder that contains your CLI Python app. You want to run this version of python. If you've set up Python in your system PATH, running Python will execute your own version of Python. Instead, you want to run the version used by CLI and add your certificate to that version. For example, your CLI Python may be at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\`.

    Use the following commands:

    ```powershell  
    cd "c:\pathtoyourcliversionofpython"
    .\python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location. Örneğin, `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem`. Your particular path depends on your OS and your CLI installation.

2. Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

    ```powershell
    $pemFile = "<Fully qualified path to the PEM certificate Ex: C:\Users\user1\Downloads\root.pem>"

    $root = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
    $root.Import($pemFile)

    Write-Host "Extracting required information from the cert file"
    $md5Hash    = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm MD5).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha1Hash   = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA1).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha256Hash = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()

    $issuerEntry  = [string]::Format("# Issuer: {0}", $root.Issuer)
    $subjectEntry = [string]::Format("# Subject: {0}", $root.Subject)
    $labelEntry   = [string]::Format("# Label: {0}", $root.Subject.Split('=')[-1])
    $serialEntry  = [string]::Format("# Serial: {0}", $root.GetSerialNumberString().ToLower())
    $md5Entry     = [string]::Format("# MD5 Fingerprint: {0}", $md5Hash)
    $sha1Entry    = [string]::Format("# SHA1 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha1Hash)
    $sha256Entry  = [string]::Format("# SHA256 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha256Hash)
    $certText = (Get-Content -Path $pemFile -Raw).ToString().Replace("`r`n","`n")

    $rootCertEntry = "`n" + $issuerEntry + "`n" + $subjectEntry + "`n" + $labelEntry + "`n" + `
    $serialEntry + "`n" + $md5Entry + "`n" + $sha1Entry + "`n" + $sha256Entry + "`n" + $certText

    Write-Host "Adding the certificate content to Python Cert store"
    Add-Content "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem" $rootCertEntry

    Write-Host "Python Cert store was updated to allow the Azure Stack CA root certificate"
    ```

### <a name="connect-to-azure-stack"></a>Azure Stack’e bağlanma

1. Register your Azure Stack environment by running the `az cloud register` command.

2. Register your environment. Use the following parameters when running `az cloud register`:

    | Değer | Örnek | Açıklama |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Ortam adı | AzureStackUser | Use `AzureStackUser`  for the user environment. If you're operator, specify `AzureStackAdmin`. |
    | Resource Manager endpoint | https://management.local.azurestack.external | The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the ASDK is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/` The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/` If you have a question about the integrated system endpoint, contact your cloud operator. |
    | Storage endpoint | local.azurestack.external | `local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | Keyvault suffix | .vault.local.azurestack.external | `.vault.local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | VM image alias doc endpoint- | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json | URI of the document, which contains VM image aliases. For more info, see [Set up the VM aliases endpoint](#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint). |

    ```azurecli  
    az cloud register -n <environmentname> --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external" --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains VM image aliases>
    ```

1. Set the active environment by using the following commands.

      ```azurecli
      az cloud set -n <environmentname>
      ```

1. Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az cloud update --profile 2019-03-01-hybrid
   ```

    >[!NOTE]  
    >If you're running a version of Azure Stack before the 1808 build, you must use the API version profile **2017-03-09-profile** rather than the API version profile **2019-03-01-hybrid**. You also need to use a recent version of the Azure CLI.
 
1. Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the `az login` command. Sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a [service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals). 

   - Sign in as a *user*: 

     You can either specify the username and password directly within the `az login` command, or authenticate by using a browser. You must do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled:

     ```azurecli
     az login -u <Active directory global administrator or user account. For example: username@<aadtenant>.onmicrosoft.com> --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com>
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, use the `az login` command without providing the `-u` parameter. Running this command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate.

   - Sign in as a *service principal*: 
    
     Before you sign in, [create a service principal through the Azure portal](azure-stack-create-service-principals.md) or CLI and assign it a role. Now, sign in by using the following command:

     ```azurecli  
     az login --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com> --service-principal -u <Application Id of the Service Principal> -p <Key generated for the Service Principal>
     ```

### <a name="test-the-connectivity"></a>Test the connectivity

With everything set up, use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an app and add a VM. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```azurecli
az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l local
```

If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource:

![Resource group create output](media/azure-stack-connect-cli/image1.png)

## <a name="windows-ad-fs"></a>Windows (AD FS)

This section walks you through setting up CLI if you're using Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) as your identity management service, and are using CLI on a Windows machine.

### <a name="trust-the-azure-stack-ca-root-certificate"></a>Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you're using the ASDK, you need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. This step isn't needed with the integrated systems.

    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location. Örneğin, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your particular path depends on your OS and the version of Python that you've installed.

2. Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

    ```powershell
    $pemFile = "<Fully qualified path to the PEM certificate Ex: C:\Users\user1\Downloads\root.pem>"

    $root = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
    $root.Import($pemFile)

    Write-Host "Extracting required information from the cert file"
    $md5Hash    = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm MD5).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha1Hash   = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA1).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha256Hash = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()

    $issuerEntry  = [string]::Format("# Issuer: {0}", $root.Issuer)
    $subjectEntry = [string]::Format("# Subject: {0}", $root.Subject)
    $labelEntry   = [string]::Format("# Label: {0}", $root.Subject.Split('=')[-1])
    $serialEntry  = [string]::Format("# Serial: {0}", $root.GetSerialNumberString().ToLower())
    $md5Entry     = [string]::Format("# MD5 Fingerprint: {0}", $md5Hash)
    $sha1Entry    = [string]::Format("# SHA1 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha1Hash)

     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, use the `az login` command without providing the `-u` parameter. Running this command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate.

   - Sign in as a *service principal*: 
    
     Prepare the .pem file to be used for service principal login.

     On the client machine where the principal was created, export the service principal certificate as a pfx with the private key located at `cert:\CurrentUser\My`. The cert name has the same name as the principal.

     Convert the pfx to pem (use the OpenSSL utility).

     Sign in to the CLI:
  
     ```azurecli  
     az login --service-principal \
      -u <Client ID from the Service Principal details> \
      -p <Certificate's fully qualified name, such as, C:\certs\spn.pem>
      --tenant <Tenant ID> \
      --debug 
     ```

### <a name="test-the-connectivity"></a>Test the connectivity

With everything set up, use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an app and add a VM. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```azurecli

## <a name="linux-azure-ad"></a>Linux (Azure AD)

This section walks you through setting up CLI if you're using Azure AD as your identity management service, and are using CLI on a Linux machine.

### <a name="trust-the-azure-stack-ca-root-certificate"></a>Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you're using the ASDK, you need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. This step isn't needed with the integrated systems.

Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

1. Find the certificate location on your machine. The location may vary depending on where you've installed Python. You need to have pip and the certifi module installed. Use the following Python command from the bash prompt:

    ```bash  
    python3 -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location. Örneğin, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your specific path depends on your operating system and the version of Python that you've installed.

2. Run the following bash command with the path to your certificate.

   - For a remote Linux machine:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat PATH_TO_PEM_FILE >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

   - For a Linux machine within the Azure Stack environment:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat /var/lib/waagent/Certificates.pem >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

### <a name="connect-to-azure-stack"></a>Azure Stack’e bağlanma

Use the following steps to connect to Azure Stack:

1. Register your Azure Stack environment by running the `az cloud register` command. In some scenarios, direct outbound internet connectivity is routed through a proxy or firewall, which enforces SSL interception. In these cases, the `az cloud register` command can fail with an error such as "Unable to get endpoints from the cloud." To work around this error, set the following environment variables:

   ```shell
   export AZURE_CLI_DISABLE_CONNECTION_VERIFICATION=1
   export ADAL_PYTHON_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
   ```

2. Register your environment. Use the following parameters when running `az cloud register`:

    | Değer | Örnek | Açıklama |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Ortam adı | AzureStackUser | Use `AzureStackUser`  for the user environment. If you're operator, specify `AzureStackAdmin`. |
    | Resource Manager endpoint | https://management.local.azurestack.external | The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the ASDK is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/` The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/` If you have a question about the integrated system endpoint, contact your cloud operator. |
    | Storage endpoint | local.azurestack.external | `local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | Keyvault suffix | .vault.local.azurestack.external | `.vault.local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | VM image alias doc endpoint- | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json | URI of the document, which contains VM image aliases. For more info, see [Set up the VM aliases endpoint](#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint). |

    ```azurecli  
    az cloud register -n <environmentname> --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external" --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains VM image aliases>
    ```

3. Set the active environment. 

      ```azurecli
        az cloud set -n <environmentname>
      ```

4. Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
      az cloud update --profile 2019-03-01-hybrid
   ```

    >[!NOTE]  
    >If you're running a version of Azure Stack before the 1808 build, you must use the API version profile **2017-03-09-profile** rather than the API version profile **2019-03-01-hybrid**. You also need to use a recent version of the Azure CLI.

5. Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the `az login` command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a [service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals). 

   * Sign in as a *user*:

     You can either specify the username and password directly within the `az login` command, or authenticate by using a browser. You must do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled:

    python3 -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location. Örneğin, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your specific path depends on your operating system and the version of Python that you've installed.

2. Run the following bash command with the path to your certificate.

   - For a remote Linux machine:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat PATH_TO_PEM_FILE >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

   - For a Linux machine within the Azure Stack environment:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat /var/lib/waagent/Certificates.pem >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

### <a name="connect-to-azure-stack"></a>Azure Stack’e bağlanma

Use the following steps to connect to Azure Stack:

1. Register your Azure Stack environment by running the `az cloud register` command. In some scenarios, direct outbound internet connectivity is routed through a proxy or firewall, which enforces SSL interception. In these cases, the `az cloud register` command can fail with an error such as "Unable to get endpoints from the cloud." To work around this error, set the following environment variables:

   ```shell
   export AZURE_CLI_DISABLE_CONNECTION_VERIFICATION=1
   export ADAL_PYTHON_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
   ```

2. Register your environment. Use the following parameters when running `az cloud register`.

    | Değer | Örnek | Açıklama |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Ortam adı | AzureStackUser | Use `AzureStackUser`  for the user environment. If you're operator, specify `AzureStackAdmin`. |
    | Resource Manager endpoint | https://management.local.azurestack.external | The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the ASDK is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/` The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/` If you have a question about the integrated system endpoint, contact your cloud operator. |
    | Storage endpoint | local.azurestack.external | `local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | Keyvault suffix | .vault.local.azurestack.external | `.vault.local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | VM image alias doc endpoint- | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json | URI of the document, which contains VM image aliases. For more info, see [Set up the VM aliases endpoint](#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint). |

    ```azurecli  
    az cloud register -n <environmentname> --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external" --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains VM image aliases>
    ```

3. Set the active environment. 

      ```azurecli
        az cloud set -n <environmentname>
      ```

4. Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
      az cloud update --profile 2019-03-01-hybrid
   ```

    >[!NOTE]  
    >If you're running a version of Azure Stack before the 1808 build, you must use the API version profile **2017-03-09-profile** rather than the API version profile **2019-03-01-hybrid**. You also need to use a recent version of the Azure CLI.

5. Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the `az login` command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a [service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals). 

6. Sign in: 

   *  As a **user** using a web browser with a device code:  

   ```azurecli  
    az login --use-device-code
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   >Running the command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate.

   * As a service principal:
        
     Prepare the .pem file to be used for service principal login.

      * On the client machine where the principal was created, export the service principal certificate as a pfx with the private key located at `cert:\CurrentUser\My`. The cert name has the same name as the principal.
  
      * Convert the pfx to pem (use the OpenSSL utility).

     Sign in to the CLI:

      ```azurecli  
      az login --service-principal \
        -u <Client ID from the Service Principal details> \
        -p <Certificate's fully qualified name, such as, C:\certs\spn.pem>
        --tenant <Tenant ID> \
        --debug 
      ```

### <a name="test-the-connectivity"></a>Test the connectivity

With everything set up, use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an app and add a VM. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```azurecli
  az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l local
```

If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource:

## <a name="known-issues"></a>Bilinen sorunlar

There are known issues when using CLI in Azure Stack:

 - The CLI interactive mode. For example, the `az interactive` command, isn't yet supported in Azure Stack.
 - To get the list of VM images available in Azure Stack, use the `az vm image list --all` command instead of the `az vm image list` command. Specifying the `--all` option ensures that the response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack environment.
 - VM image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack. When using VM images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the `az vm images list` command.
