- Remediation: Follow the resource provider update process to apply the SQL resource provider hotfix 1.1.47.0 after Azure Stack is upgraded to the 1910 update ([SQL RP version 1.1.47.0](https://aka.ms/azurestacksqlrp11470)). For the MySQL resource provider, it is also recommended that you apply the MySQL resource provider hotfix 1.1.47.0 after Azure Stack is upgraded to 1910 update ([MySQL RP version 1.1.47.0](https://aka.ms/azurestackmysqlrp11470)).

- Occurrence: Common

### <a name="network-security-groups"></a>Ağ Güvenlik Grupları

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases. 
- Cause: An explicit **DenyAllOutbound** rule cannot be created in an NSG as this will prevent all internal communication to infrastructure needed for the VM deployment to complete.

#### <a name="vpn-troubleshooter"></a>VPN troubleshooter

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: In the user portal, the **Connections** blade displays a feature called **VPN Troubleshooter**. This feature is currently not supported in Azure Stack.
- Occurrence: Common

#### <a name="documentation"></a>Belgeler

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: The documentation links in the overview page of Virtual Network gateway link to Azure-specific documentation instead of Azure Stack. Use the following links for the Azure Stack documentation:

  - [Gateway SKUs](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-skus)
  - [Highly Available Connections](../user/azure-stack-vpn-gateway-about-vpn-gateways.md#gateway-availability)

## <a name="compute"></a>İşlem

### <a name="vm-boot-diagnostics"></a>VM boot diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When creating a new Windows virtual machine (VM), the following error might be displayed: **Failed to start virtual machine 'vm-name'. Error: Failed to update serial output settings for VM 'vm-name'** . The error occurs if you enable boot diagnostics on a VM, but delete your boot diagnostics storage account.
- Remediation: Recreate the storage account with the same name you used previously.
- Occurrence: Common

### <a name="consumed-compute-quota"></a>Consumed compute quota

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- When creating a new virtual machine, you may receive an error such as **This subscription is at capacity for Total Regional vCPUs on this location. This subscription is using all 50 Total Regional vCPUs available.** . This indicates that the quota for total cores available to you has been reached.
- Remediation: Ask your operator for an add-on plan with additional quota. Editing the current plan's quota will not work or reflect increased quota.
- Occurrence: Rare

### <a name="virtual-machine-scale-set"></a>Sanal makine ölçek kümesi

#### <a name="create-failures-during-patch-and-update-on-4-node-azure-stack-environments"></a>Create failures during patch and update on 4-node Azure Stack environments

- Cause: Creating VMs in an availability set of 3 fault domains and creating a virtual machine scale set instance fails with a **FabricVmPlacementErrorUnsupportedFaultDomainSize** error during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack environment.
- Remediation: You can create single VMs in an availability set with 2 fault domains successfully. However, scale set instance creation is still not available during the update process on a 4-node Azure Stack deployment.

### <a name="ubuntu-ssh-access"></a>Ubuntu SSH access

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: An Ubuntu 18.04 VM created with SSH authorization enabled does not allow you to use the SSH keys to sign in.
- Remediation: Use VM access for the Linux extension to implement SSH keys after provisioning, or use password-based authentication.
- Occurrence: Common

## <a name="1908-update-process"></a>1908 update process

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When attempting to install the Azure Stack update, the status for the update might fail and change state to **PreparationFailed**. This is caused by the update resource provider (URP) being unable to properly transfer the files from the storage container to an internal infrastructure share for processing.
- Remediation: Starting with version 1901 (1.1901.0.95), you can work around this issue by clicking **Update now** again (not **Resume**). The URP then cleans up the files from the previous attempt, and restarts the download.

- Remediation: None.
- Occurrence: Common

### <a name="rainy-cloud-on-scale-set-diagnostics"></a>Rainy cloud on scale set diagnostics

- Applicable: This issue applies to the 1906 and 1907 releases.
- Cause: The virtual machine scale set overview page shows an empty chart. Clicking on the empty chart opens a "rainy cloud" blade. This is the chart for scale set diagnostic information, such as CPU percentage, and is not a feature supported in the current Azure Stack build.
- Remediation: None.
- Occurrence: Common

## <a name="1906-update-process"></a>1906 update process

- Applicable: This issue applies to all supported releases.
- Cause: When attempting to install the 1906 Azure Stack update, the status for the update might fail and change state to **PreparationFailed**. This is caused by the update resource provider (URP) being unable to properly transfer the files from the storage container to an internal infrastructure share for processing. 
- Remediation: Starting with version 1901 (1.1901.0.95), you can work around this issue by clicking **Update now** again (not **Resume**). The URP then cleans up the files from the previous attempt, and restarts the download. If the problem persists, we recommend manually uploading the update package by following the [Import and install updates section](azure-stack-apply-updates.md).
